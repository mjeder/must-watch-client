# #MustWatch
It's a cold and rainy Sunday... you decide it's a perfect opportunity to lay down on the couch with a blanket, bowl of popcorn, and your favorite beverage and finally turn on a movie or TV show. BUT... you can't remember the name of that TV show all of your co-workers are talking about or the name of the movie your friends always give you a hard time for not seeing yet. 

So, what do you do? 

You pull out your phone and log into your #MustWatch account to view your list of TV shows and movies that you've been told you must watch!
___
**#MustWatch** is an application for users to create an account and log the movies or tv shows that they've been hearing about from friends, family, and social media. Once those shows are on their #MustWatch list they can add more, edit, remove, view their list, or screenshot and share with friends!

This is my second project at General Assembly and the goal was to create a full stack
web application hosted live on GH-Pages with an API hosted on Heroku. The main objectives
were to:
- [ ] Build a single-page application (SPA) with basic user authentication
(sign up, sign in, sign out, change password) that interacts with a custom API that you build.
- [ ] Build an app that can create, read, update, and delete data in a database.
- [ ] Create user stories, ERDs and wireframes as part of planning out your app.
- [ ] Confidently present your work to a technical audience (5-10 minute presentation)

## Planning Story
I started off by writing user stories that would satisfy the requirements of the project and build a solid foundation for v1.0 of my application. Once I was able to document and decide on the user needs, I was able to start building out my wireframe and ERD to visualize how the application would look and operate. This lead to me creating a to-do list so I could stick to a daily schedule and ensure I would deliver my v1.0 by the deadline.
